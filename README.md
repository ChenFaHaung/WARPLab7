## Introduction

WARPLab is a framework for rapid physical layer prototyping that allows for coordination of arbitrary combinations of single and multi-antenna transmit and receive nodes. The extensible framework gives users the flexibility to develop and deploy large arrays of nodes to meet any application or research need.

* The WARPLab reference design is an implementation of the WARPLab framework that allows many physical layer designs to be constructed and tested. 
* The reference design combines MATLAB and FPGA implementations of the WARPLab framework modules that allow for easy extensibility and customization.
* While the reference design uses MATLAB to control nodes and perform signal processing, it also allows applications with strict latency requirements to move time critical processing in to the FPGA. 

> **Notice:**
> * The latest WARPLab 7 reference design runs on both **WARP v2** and **WARP v3** hardware. 
> * Users with **WARP v1** hardware should use **WARPLab 6**.
> * WARPLab 7 is a complete rewrite of the original WARPLab framework. This rewrite was created and is maintained by engineers at [Mango Communications](http://www.mangocomm.com/).
